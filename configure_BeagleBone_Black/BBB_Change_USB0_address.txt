The BeagleBone Black board comes with a virtual network interface usb0 that works over USB. The usb0 IP address defaults to 192.68.7.2. I have two of them and wanted to change the IP address for one to 192.168.8.2.
I'm using the Debian wheezy distribution and you just need to modify 3 files:

/etc/network/interfaces
/opt/scripts/boot/am335x_evm.sh
/etc/udhcpd.conf

In /etc/network/interfaces and /opt/scripts/boot/am335x_evm.sh, change "192.168.7.2" to "192.168.8.2" (or whatever you want the new IP address to be).

In /etc/udhcpd.conf, change "192.168.7.1" to "192.168.8.1" in two places. This file configures the DHCP IP address that is given to your PC when it initializes the USB virtual ethernet interface. Keep in mind that the default netmask for the usb0 interface is 255.255.255.252, so make sure your new IP addresses are compatible with that or change the netmask accordingly.

After making these changes and rebooting, the IP address for usb0 on your BeagleBone Black should be 192.168.8.2 and the IP address for the virtual ethernet interface on the PC side should be 192.168.8.1.
